## Demo of inter-op with Python package from Clojure (JVM)
  - The interop is done using the [libpython-clj](https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj)_library
  - This demo uses excellent scraping package for Python [`Trafilatura`]() 

## Steps
- Install Trafilatura package on machine
  - `pip install trafilatura`
  - [instructions](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)

- Fire up Clojure REPL

- Import necessary dependencies
```clojure
(require
    '[libpython-clj2.python :as py :refer [py. py.. py.-]]
    '[libpython-clj2.require :refer [require-python]])

(require-python '[trafilatura :as tf])
```

 We‚Äôre spending Women‚Äôs History Month with women leaders who are making history every day in the tech community. Read more about Erin Spiceland: Software Engineer at SpaceX.
 Every March we recognize the women who have shaped history‚Äîand now, we‚Äôre taking a look forward. From driving software development in large companies to maintaining thriving open source communities, we‚Äôre spending Women‚Äôs History Month with women leaders who are making history every day in the tech community. Erin Spiceland is a Software Engineer for SpaceX. Born and raised in rural south Georgia, she is a Choctaw and Chickasaw mother of two now living in downtown Los Angeles. Erin didn‚Äôt finish college‚Äîshe‚Äôs a predominantly self-taught software engineer. In her spare time, she makes handmade Native American beadwork and regalia and attends powwows.
 My career has been a winding road through periods of stimulation and health as well as periods of personal misery. During it all, I‚Äôve learned a variety of programming languages and technologies while working on a diverse array of products and services. I‚Äôm a domestic abuse survivor and a Choctaw bisexual polyamorous woman. I‚Äôm so proud of myself that I made it this far considering where I came from.
 In 2007, I had a three-year-old daughter and I was trying to finish my computer science degree one class at a time, all while keeping my house and family running smoothly. I found the math classes exciting and quickly finished my math minor, leaving only computer science classes. I was looking at about five years before I would graduate. Then, my husband at the time recommended me for an entry software developer position at a telecom and digital communications company.
 When faced with the choice between an expensive computer science degree and getting paid to do what I loved, I dropped out of college and accepted the job. I was hired to work on internal tooling, and eventually, products. I did a lot of development on product front-ends, embedded network devices, and a distributed platform-as-a-service. I learned Java/JSP, Python, JavaScript/CSS, Node.js, as well as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and distributed systems architecture. It was an intense experience that required a lot of self-teaching, asking others for help, and daycare, but it set me up for my later successes.
 I appreciate and admire technical, effective leaders who care for their reports as humans, not as lines on a burndown chart, and forego heavy-handed direction in favor of communication and mutual dialogue. I think it‚Äôs as important for a leader to concern herself with her coworkers‚Äô personal well-being as it is for her to direct their performance.
 Last year I took a pay cut to move from a safe, easy job where I had security to work in a language I hadn‚Äôt seen in years and with systems more complicated than anything I‚Äôd worked with before. I moved from a place where I had a huge four bedroom house to a studio apartment that was twice the price. I moved away from my children, of who I share custody with my ex-husband. We fly across the U.S. to see each other now. I miss my children every day. However, I get to be a wonderful role model for them.
 I can‚Äôt wait to wake up every day with my partner who loves me so much. I‚Äôm looking forward to showing my children exactly how far they can go. I‚Äôm excited to keep exploring Los Angeles.

  \"Comedy never travels‚Ä¶\" \"What about German Comedy?\"
  German Globetrotter: 'Faraway' is Netflix's #2 Film Worldwide
  That said, there is a vibrant and unique comedic landscape in Germany which deserves to be celebrated. No joke. Last year saw Germany make an impactful entry into the 94th Academy Awards with the comedy, Ich bin dein Mensch (I'm Your Man). And then there was 2016's Toni Erdmann being met with widespread critical acclaim for its wit and social commentary (which Jack Nicholson once circled to star in its remake).
  For many, watching characters navigate places of paradise means living vicariously through them ‚Äì experiencing escapism without departing the sofa. Maybe that's it ‚Äì after years in a pandemic, ongoing geopolitical and natural earthquakes ‚Äî audiences just want to feel good. And escape. If you allow yourself to be whisked away to Croatia and forget about the world's problems ‚Äì could that work? \"Without a shadow of a doubt, the reason that people tune into rom-coms more during periods of crisis and stress is because of the distraction that these genres offer,\" Emma Kenny, a UK-based TV psychologist, says.
  Eat, Pray, Love is the Rom-Com travel classic ‚Äì chronicling Julia Roberts as Liz Gilbert as she embarks on a journey to find balance in her life following a difficult divorce. Robert's more recent release, Ticket to Paradise, is also a romanticised ode to travel, grossing more than $172.1MM ‚Äì making it the biggest Rom-Com to feature two over-50 leads since 2009's It's Complicated. Which begs the question whether an escapist experience as Faraway would have been better served in a cinema setting?
  We're now also in a world where older actresses are becoming unafraid of exploring their onscreen sexuality ‚Äì exemplified by Emma Thompson in Good Luck to you, Leo Grande, and Kate Winslet in Mare of Easttown (who took a stand to ensure her 'visible belly' during a sex scene was not edited out). Now we find Faraway's Zeynap (Naomi Krauss) fearlessly embracing her age, which, in a very honest portrayal, might also serve as an ingredient in a sexy-secret-
  A wager fulfilled by Netflix dubbing Faraway for global audiences, Rom-Coms never fail to engage audiences ‚Äì despite their language. And when combined with the romantic lure of travel, they become even more captivating. Love is, after all, a universal language, and there is just something spellbinding about a romance that unfolds in a destination faraway.
  Who knows, maybe we'll be seeing a remake with Roberts in the future.
